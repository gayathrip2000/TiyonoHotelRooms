This project is developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, a popular technology stack for building web applications. It utilizes MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the web framework, React.js as the front-end library, and Node.js as the back-end runtime environment.

The project is a task management application that allows users to create, assign, and track tasks. It provides features such as user registration, task creation, assignment, and status tracking. The data collected from these functions is stored in MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database.

Express.js serves as the web framework, enabling the creation of RESTful APIs to connect the React.js front-end with the Node.js back-end and MongoDB. React.js is utilized as the front-end library, allowing for the development of a dynamic and interactive user interface. It efficiently updates data without requiring page refreshes, providing a seamless user experience.
